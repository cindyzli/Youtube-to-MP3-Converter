# Youtube-to-MP3-Converter
Takes a Youtube URL and downloads an output audio mp3 file for the video.

I made this because I personally had problems with the existing YT to MP3 converter websites/chrome extensions because of their weird and malicious ads. I'm working on making this into an ad free chrome extension. For now, it is a simple python script that imports youtube, moviepy.editor, os, and time.

To use it, just put in the Youtube URL where it says so and run the code. A file should be downloaded called 'output_audio.mp3', feel free to change it as you may. Hope you enjoy!
